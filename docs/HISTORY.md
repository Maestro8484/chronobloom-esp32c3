# Project History

## Lineage: Steve Manley → Mike van der Sluis → Maestro

---

## Steve Manley (2015-2016)

### Original Vision
**Creator of the 3-ring NeoPixel clock concept**

### Hardware
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Nano
- **Timekeeping**: DS3234 SPI RTC module with CR2032 backup battery
- **Display**: Adafruit NeoPixel rings (60/24/12 LEDs)
- **Input**: Two push buttons on GPIO7/8 (polled, no interrupts)
- **Enclosure**: 3D printed base and face plates (Google SketchUp), wooden cabinet frame (lathe-turned)
- **Material**: UV glow-in-dark PLA filament (charges from LEDs and ambient light)

### Software
- **Architecture**: Proven render order (face → seconds → minutes → hours) still used today
- **Timekeeping**: Hardware 1Hz interrupt from DS3234 drives clock ticks
- **Features**: MSGEQ7 audio spectrum analyzer integration for music-reactive rainbow modes
- **Button handling**: Loop-wait polling (immune to EMI noise)

### Key Contributions
1. **Concentric ring layout** — Visual metaphor of time as expanding circles
2. **UV glow-in-dark aesthetic** — Frame glows softly in darkness after LED exposure
3. **Stable architecture** — Render order and button polling patterns proven over years
4. **Light bleed mitigation** — 3D print settings and divider designs to prevent LED cross-talk

### Documentation
- YouTube playlist (2016): Build process, lathe-turned wooden cabinet
- Blog posts on Embedded.com: Design decisions and electrical specs
- Collaboration with Max Maxfield (EE Times): Technical discussions on NeoPixel wiring strategies

## Mike van der Sluis (2020-2021)

### Cost-Optimization Focus
**Goal**: Make Steve's design accessible with cheaper components

### Hardware Changes
- **NeoPixel rings**: Chinese clones from AliExpress (not Adafruit originals)
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Nano clone with CH340G USB-serial chip
- **Same RTC**: DS3234 module (kept for reliability)

### Challenges Solved
1. **Dimensional mismatch**: Clone rings had different diameters than Adafruit
2. **STL modifications**: Redesigned 3D printed parts to fit clone ring dimensions
3. **Driver compatibility**: Windows CH340G driver installation guide

### Software Simplification
- **Removed**: MSGEQ7 audio reactive features
- **Kept**: Core clock functionality (time display, buttons, RTC)
- **Result**: Simpler firmware focused purely on timekeeping

### Documentation
- **Instructable** (July 2020): "Neopixel Clock With Three Neopixel Rings"
- **Audience**: Beginners (detailed Arduino IDE setup, library installation)
- **Philosophy**: "An important Dutch habit is always trying to save money ;-)"

### Key Contributions
1. **Hardware accessibility** — Proved the design works with budget components
2. **Modified STL files** — Community can use wider variety of NeoPixel rings
3. **Beginner-friendly docs** — Lowered barrier to entry for new builders

## Maestro (2022-2026)

### Evolution Journey
**Two physical builds** → **Four-year production deployment** → **ESP32-C3 modernization**

### Phase 1: First Build (2022) — 8.5" Clock
- **Scale**: 85% (0.85x) to maximize Bambu Labs P1S print bed (256mm x 256mm)
- **Microcontroller**: Started with Arduino Nano (following Mike's design)
- **Brief ESP8266 experiment**: Abandoned due to RAM/flash constraints
- **Material innovation**: UV glow-in-dark PLA (following Steve's aesthetic)

### Phase 2: Large Build (2022-2023) — 15" Wall Clock
- **Scale**: 200% (2x) requiring part segmentation
- **Fabrication**: Hybrid approach (FDM 3D printing + CO2 laser cutting)
- **Laser bed**: 600mm x 410mm allowed single-piece acrylic face
- **Assembly**: Parametric thirds design with alignment pins
- **Deployment**: Wall-mounted in home, ran continuously for 4 years

#### Collaboration Period (March-May 2026)
- **Claude Chat**: Planning, architecture, feature design
- **Claude Code**: Implementation, builds, flashing, debugging

2. **Hybrid fabrication workflow** — Combined FDM + laser cutting advantages
3. **Parchment paper diffuser** — Optimal light distribution discovery
4. **ESP32-C3 smart features** — Web UI, NTP, sensors, animations
5. **Dual build variants** — Compile-time configuration for 8" vs 15"

## Philosophy Continuity

### What Stayed the Same
- **3-ring analog metaphor** — Position = time, color = information
- **UV glow-in-dark aesthetic** — Frame charges from LEDs, glows in darkness
- **Proven render order** — Face → seconds → minutes → hours (Steve's original)
- **Build-it-yourself ethos** — Open source, community-improvable

### What Changed
- **From standalone to connected** — WiFi enables remote control, NTP sync
- **From static to adaptive** — Sensors enable auto-brightness, environmental response
- **From simple to smart** — Web UI, animations, persistent settings
- **From single-scale to parametric** — Multiple size variants from same codebase

### What Was Learned
1. **Hardware RTC is reliable** — Steve's DS3234 choice was correct (battery backup invaluable)
2. **Button polling > ISRs** — Steve's polled approach immune to GPIO noise (Maestro's ISR regression)
3. **Cheap clones work** — Mike proved cost reduction doesn't sacrifice functionality
4. **UV PLA is magical** — Glow-in-dark effect enhances the light bloom aesthetic
5. **Parchment paper wins** — Better than frosted acrylic or spray-painted glass
6. **ESP32 is overkill (in a good way)** — WiFi + sensors + OTA + future expansion justify complexity

## Community Impact

### Derivative Builds
Multiple makers have built variants inspired by Steve's original:
- Hagyma's Thingiverse remix (2017): Modified for Chinese LED rings
- Peter Neufeld's kinetic variant (2020): Added rotating outer ring with magnets
- Various WordClock projects adopted the concentric ring aesthetic

### Educational Value
- Arduino beginners learn: NeoPixel control, RTC interfacing, button debouncing
- Intermediate builders learn: 3D design iteration, laser cutting, hybrid fabrication
- Advanced users learn: ESP32 web servers, EEPROM management, I2C sensors

**Mike van der Sluis**: For making it accessible to budget-conscious makers. The modified STLs and beginner-friendly documentation expanded the builder community.

**Maestro**: For modernizing the platform without losing the soul. Web UI and sensors enhance but don't replace the core analog timekeeping experience.
